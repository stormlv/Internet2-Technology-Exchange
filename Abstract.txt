Use of Dynamic Circuits in PhEDEx, the CMS data distribution framework

PhEDEx is the data placement and management tool for the CMS experiment at the LHC. It
controls the large-scale data-flows on the WAN across the experiment, typically handling 1 PB
of data per week.

ANSE (Advanced Network Services for Experiments) is an NSF funded project, which aims to 
integrate advanced network-aware tools in the mainstream production workflows of ATLAS and CMS.
In the context of CMS, it seeks to integrate bandwidth provisioning capabilities in PhEDEx, as well
as to improve its network awareness for smart source selection.

Development work in PhEDEX related to the integration of bandwidth provisioning support is already well past
its prototype phase and is set to be released in production by the start of Run 2. PhEDEx will 
thus be able to make use of bandwidth provisioning systems, as soon as they are mature enough.

In this paper we present the general architecture of the new circuit management framework that
we propose in PhEDEx, give technical details regarding its implementation, show possible use cases for it
and reveal future plans.
